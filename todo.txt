x 2019-04-20 (B) decorate tag @done +Decorate purple
x 2019-04-21 (B) add build step to make a VSIX package so I can install on my own +Config
decorate due date, today and overdue +Decorate purple, yellow bold, red bold
increase/decrease priority or remove priority +Line
add/remove waiting/next tags (do I need these? Or do they go into separate .txt files?) +Line
add due date, shortcut +Line due:tomorrow
quick sorts/views: Next (any A or top priority), Project, due, tag value +List
move from inbox.txt to todo.txt, someday.txt or to a project file or create a Project.md +File
archive tasks to done.txt +File
move to inbox from project - maybe a "next" that tags/prioritizes and moves to inbox) +File
make test file from official format document +Test
write test cases for decorators (how?) +Test
write test cases for line commands +Test
write test cases for file commands +Test
defer a task (what does that mean? Should it be a separate .txt file that is different than someday?)
follow note:xxx link
take chunk of text and create note and save name in clipboard
flush all changes to Git (maybe not necessary if I have the job)
iterate through all projects for reviewing (and other files). Maybe something in project files where I use MD meta data at the top to show last reviewed so the review process can just show me what needs to be reviewed?

operators i will need
- get priority: return range and value
- get project: for sorting
- get context: for sorting
- get tag: for sorting
- replace priority
- append tag
- delete lines in file
- append lines to file
- open note file

Project that uses settings in package.json and then retrieves them in code.
https://github.com/foxundermoon/vs-shell-format
=======
Packaging:
from the root folder of the extension, enter

    vsce package

This will create a .vsix file (you have to change the first few lines of
the README.md file for it to work). You install vsce with

    sudo npm install -g vsce

Then you can install the extension with

    code --install-extension todotxt-mode-0.0.1.vsix 

I had to restart VS code to see the effect. You can uninstall it from the UI or
from the code command.

(Need to decide if waiting is a tag or presence in a file)
choices:
  - move to a file
  - context @wait
  - tag wait:tom
  - priority (W)
tag and context allow them to stay in todo.txt or other file
tag allows knowing who
moving to file gets it off list and easy to review later
prority seems like a kludge but is somewhat right

(Need to decide if defer is a tag or presence in a file)
choices:
  - move to a file
  - context @defer
  - tag defer:yyyy-mm-dd
  - priority (D)
tag and context allow them to stay in todo.txt or other file
tag allows knowing when to look at again (but was always an issue with Todoist if the date isn't real
  and I just want to do it later, which is the usual)
move to file means just more files
priority seems like a kludge but sort of works

need to read about alternatives to GTD in todo.txt for different "states"
