x 2019-04-26 (A) make all sorts, formats, moves work on selected row ranges
(B) move from inbox.txt to to a project file or create a Project.md +File
(B) command to follow a note:xxx link
(B) command to take text selection and create note and save in clipboard (or add to task above selection?)
(B) search command to find all tasks with high priority (A/B) or overdue or due within next 5 days
(B) iterate through all projects for reviewing (and other files). Maybe something in project files where I use MD meta data at the top to show last reviewed so the review process can just show me what needs to be reviewed?

increase/decrease priority or remove priority +Line
make configurable (file names, keybindings, colors)
make test file from official format document +Test
write test cases for decorators (how?) +Test
write test cases for line commands +Test

maybe better to have two commands: 
1) move to project, which interactively selects the project file (do I really need this? so easy to just copy/paste)
2) create project from task, which prompts for a file name and creates a new project file (same with this one)
how would command with note work:
- enter some notes, probably below the task
- select the notes and cmd-shift-p and run create task note which prompts with [Task]-Note-yyyy-mm-dd.md (task selected)
- on enter, copies text, appends to file with "### <file>" and text below
- deletes selected text
- adds note:<file> to clipboard
- puts informational message to paste note tag to appropriate task
