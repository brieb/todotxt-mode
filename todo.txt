take chunk of text and create note and save name in clipboard
flush all changes to Git (maybe not necessary if I have the job)
iterate through all projects for reviewing (and other files). Maybe something in project files where I use MD meta data at the top to show last reviewed so the review process can just show me what needs to be reviewed?

(Need to decide if waiting is a tag or presence in a file)
choices:
  - move to a file
  - context @wait
  - tag wait:tom
  - priority (W)
tag and context allow them to stay in todo.txt or other file
tag allows knowing who
moving to file gets it off list and easy to review later
prority seems like a kludge but is somewhat right

(Need to decide if defer is a tag or presence in a file)
choices:
  - move to a file
  - context @defer
  - tag defer:yyyy-mm-dd
  - priority (D)
tag and context allow them to stay in todo.txt or other file
tag allows knowing when to look at again (but was always an issue with Todoist if the date isn't real
  and I just want to do it later, which is the usual)
move to file means just more files
priority seems like a kludge but sort of works

need to read about alternatives to GTD in todo.txt for different "states"
