command to follow a note:xxx link
search command to find all tasks with high priority (A/B) or overdue or due within next 5 days

x 2019-05-04 (A) add an option as a section delimiter (eg '^--$') that if set will break the .txt file into regions that are ignored?

maybe better to have two commands: 
1) move to project, which interactively selects the project file (do I really need this? so easy to just copy/paste)
2) create project from task, which prompts for a file name and creates a new project file (same with this one)
(A) need to add this
